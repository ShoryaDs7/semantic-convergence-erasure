## Overview

This repository contains the canonical research preprint and formal materials
for **Semantic-Convergence Erasure** — a theoretical result establishing a
necessary lower bound on irreversible information erasure in long-lived,
meaning-preserving computation.

The work studies the thermodynamic cost of semantic preservation over time,
bridging reversible computation, semantic equivalence, and explicit erasure
accounting.
